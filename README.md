Indian Sign Language to Text/Speech translation
-
Create a solution that translates Indian Sign Language (ISL) into text and speech in real-time, facilitating communication for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community with the hearing world. The application should be capable of recognizing and interpreting a comprehensive library of ISL signs and gestures, and then provide accurate text and speech output in multiple Indian languages.
